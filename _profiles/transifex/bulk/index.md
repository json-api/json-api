# Bulk profile

## Introduction

This page specifies a profile for the `application/vnd.api+json` media type,
as described in the [JSON:API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

This profile allows clients to perform a number of operations with only one
request. Instead of supporting arbitrary operations on the whole API, this
profile limits operations of the same type (aka HTTP verb: `POST`, `PATCH`,
`DELETE`) on the same API resource.

## Creating Resources In Bulk

### Requests

A collection of resources can be created by sending a `POST` request to a URL
that represents a collection of resources. The request **MUST** include an
array of resource objects as primary data. All items of the array **MUST** have
the same `type` member. The same restrictions that apply to a resource object
when creating a single resource apply to each item of the array. Either all the
items in the request **MUST** include client-generated IDs, or none **MUST**.

Every bulk create operation **MUST** be atomic. If the server has changed, all
the requested items **MUST** have been created. Also, no side-effects are to be
expected to happen asynchronously on the server's side; assuming no further
interaction with the server, the returned items **SHOULD** remain as they are
and further attempts to fetch them **SHOULD** return the same resource objects.

For instance, a collection of articles might be created with the following
request:

```
POST /articles HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json;profile="https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
Accept: application/vnd.api+json;profile="https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md",application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "attributes": {"title": "Creating resources in bulk"}
    },
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "attributes": {"title": "Creating many resources at the same time"}
      "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"type": "users", "id": "1"}}}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Responses

#### `201 Created`

If the requested items did not include Client-Generated IDs and the requested
resources have been created successfully, the server **MUST** return a
`201 Created` status code.

The server **MUST NOT** include a `Location` header.

The response **MUST** also include a document that contains an array with the
primary resources created, in the same order as they appear in the request.

For instance, A response when all requested items were created can be:

```
201 Created
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {"title": "Creating resources in bulk"}
    },
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "2",
      "attributes": {"title": "Handling responses in bulk creation"}
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "profile": [
      "https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### `204 No Content`

If the requested items did include a Client-Generated ID and the requested
resources have been created successfully, the server **MUST** return either a
`201 Created` status code and response document (as described above) or a
`204 No Content` status code with no response document.


> Note: If a 204 response is received the client should consider the resources
> object sent in the request to be accepted by the server, as if the server had
> returned them back in a 201 response.

#### Failure

In case of failure, a normal JSON:API error response **MUST** be returned as
described in the specification. The errors of the response **SHOULD** only
describe the requested items that caused a problem with the server; requested
items that would have been accepted on their own **SHOULD NOT** be reflected in
the response.

In case of multiple errors, like with error responses as described in the
JSON:API specification, the most generally applicable HTTP error code
**SHOULD** be used in the response.

In order for the client to identify which of the requested items caused the
failure, the error object **SHOULD** include the `source` member with a
`pointer`.

For instance, a response when the server encountered a problem while creating
the first and third item in a bulk request can be:

```
400 Bad Request
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "403",
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "detail": "You do not have permissions to perform this action",
      "source": {"pointer": "/data/0"}
    },
    {
      "status": "409",
      "title": "Conflict",
      "detail": "An article with the same title already exists",
      "source": {"pointer": "/data/2/attributes/title"}
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "profile": [
      "https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Updating Resources In Bulk

### Requests

A collection of resources can be updated by sending a `PATCH` request to a URL
that represents a collection of resources. The request **MUST** include an
array of resource objects as primary data. All items of the array **MUST** have
the same `type` member. An `id` member is also required to identify the
resource being edited. The same restrictions that apply to a resource object
when updating a single resource apply to each item of the array.

Every bulk update operation **MUST** be atomic. If the server has changed, all
the requested updates **MUST** have been applied. Also, no side-effects are to
be expected to happen asynchronously on the server's side; assuming no further
interaction with the server, the returned items **SHOULD** remain as they are
and further attempts to fetch them **SHOULD** return the same resource objects.

For instance, a collection of article updates might be performed with the
following request:

```
PATCH /articles HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json;profile="https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
Accept: application/vnd.api+json;profile="https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md",application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {"title": "Creating resources in bulk"}
    },
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "2",
      "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"type": "users", "id": "1"}}}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Responses

#### `200 OK`

If a server accepts an update but also changes at least one of the resources in
ways other than those specified by the request (for example, updating the
`updated-at` attribute or a computed `sha`), it **MUST** return a `200 OK`
response. The response document **MUST** include an array of representations of
the updated resources as if a `GET` request was made to the request URL, in the
same order as they appear in the request.

The server **MUST NOT** include a `Location` header.

For instance, A response when all requested items were updated can be:

```
200 OK
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {"title": "Creating resources in bulk"},
      "relationships": {
          "author": {"data": {"type": "users", "id": "1"},
                     "links": {"self": "/articles/1/relationships/author",
                               "related": "/articles/1/author"}}
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "2",
      "attributes": {"title": "Handling responses in bulk creation"},
      "relationships": {
          "author": {"data": {"type": "users", "id": "2"},
                     "links": {"self": "/articles/2/relationships/author",
                               "related": "/articles/2/author"}}
      }
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "profile": [
      "https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
    ]
  }
}
```
#### `204 No Content`

If an update is successful and the server doesnâ€™t update any attributes besides
those provided, the server **MUST** return either a 200 OK status code and
response document (as described above) or a 204 No Content status code with no
response document.


#### Failure

In case of failure, a normal JSON:API error response **MUST** be returned as
described in the specification. The errors of the response **SHOULD** only
describe the requested items that caused a problem with the server; requested
items that would have been accepted on their own **SHOULD NOT** be reflected in
the response.

In case of multiple errors, like with error responses as described in the
JSON:API specification, the most generally applicable HTTP error code
**SHOULD** be used in the response.

In order for the client to identify which of the requested items caused the
failure, the error object **SHOULD** include the `source` member with a
`pointer`.

For instance, a response when the server encountered a problem while updating the
first and third item in a bulk request can be:

```
400 Bad Request
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "403",
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "detail": "You do not have permissions to perform this action",
      "source": {"pointer": "/data/0"}
    },
    {
      "status": "409",
      "title": "Conflict",
      "detail": "An article with the same title already exists",
      "source": {"pointer": "/data/2/attributes/title"}
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "profile": [
      "https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deleting Resources In Bulk

### Requests

A collection of resources can be deleted by sending a `DELETE` request to a URL
that represents a collection of resources. The request **MUST** include an
array of resource identifier objects as primary data. All items of the array
**MUST** have the same `type` member. An `id` member is also required to
identify the resource being edited.

Every bulk delete operation **MUST** be atomic. If the server has changed, all
the requested items **MUST** have been deleted. Also, no side-effects are to be
expected to happen asynchronously on the server's side.

For instance, a collection of articles might be deleted with the following
request:

```
DELETE /articles HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json;profile="https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
Accept: application/vnd.api+json;profile="https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md",application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [
    {"type": "articles", "id": 1},
    {"type": "articles", "id": 2}
  ]
}
```

### Responses

#### `204 No Content`

A server **MUST** return a 204 No Content status code if a deletion request is
successful and no content is returned.

#### `200 OK`

A server **MUST** return a 200 OK status code if a deletion request is
successful and the server responds with only top-level meta data.

#### Failure

In case of failure, a normal JSON:API error response **MUST** be returned as
described in the specification. The errors of the response **SHOULD** only
describe the requested items that caused a problem with the server; requested
items that would have been accepted on their own **SHOULD NOT** be reflected in
the response.

In case of multiple errors, like with error responses as described in the
JSON:API specification, the most generally applicable HTTP error code
**SHOULD** be used in the response.

In order for the client to identify which of the requested items caused the
failure, the error object **SHOULD** include the `source` member with a
`pointer`.

For instance, a response when the server encountered a problem while creating
the first and third item in a bulk request can be:

```
400 Bad Request
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "404",
      "title": "Not Found",
      "detail": "Article with id '1' was not found",
      "source": {"pointer": "/data/0/id"}
    },
    {
      "status": "403",
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "detail": "You do not have permissions to perform this action",
      "source": {"pointer": "/data/2"}
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "profile": [
      "https://github.com/json-api/json-api/_profiles/transifex/bulk/index.md"
    ]
  }
}
```
