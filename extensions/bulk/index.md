title: "Bulk Extension (Deprecated)"
---

JSON:API previously offered experimental support for a different extension
negotiation system than the one now in the specification, and it provided a
number of extensions for use with that old negotiation system. However, this
system was always experimental and has now been deprecated.

New APIs should not use the old system or any extensions designed for it.
APIs that already use these old extensions should direct clients to an
[earlier version of this page](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/9c7a03dbc37f80f6ca81b16d444c960e96dd7a57/extensions/index.md)
as documentation.
