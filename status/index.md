title: "JSON API: Specification Status"
---

**The [base JSON API specification](/format) has reached stable status.**

Future changes to the base specification will always be backwards compatible
using a _never remove, only add_ strategy.

**JSON API's [extensions](/extensions) are still a work in progress** and
may change as implementation work progresses. Implementors should be aware
that extensions are not yet stable.

Work on this specification is being done at its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/json-api/json-api). Please feel free to help
flesh it out or, if you try to write an implementation, to tell us where things
were ambiguous. The best way to do so is to [file an
Issue](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues).
