## Status

**This document is a work in progress** and will likely change over the
next month as implementation work progresses. Implementors should be
aware that this specification is not stable. It is currently missing
some details about the `meta` attribute and could be more precise about
details of working with relationships.

Work on this specification is being done at its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/json-api/json-api). Please feel
free to help flesh it out or, if you try to write an implementation, to
tell us where things were ambiguous. The best way to do so is to
[file an Issue](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues).
