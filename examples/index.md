## <a href="#sparse-fieldsets" id="sparse-fieldsets" class="headerlink"></a> Sparse Fieldsets

Examples of how [sparse fieldsets](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) work.

Basic request:

```http
GET /articles?include=author HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!",
      "body": "The shortest article. Ever.",
      "created": "2015-05-22T14:56:29.000Z",
      "updated": "2015-05-22T14:56:28.000Z"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "data": {"id": "42", "type": "people"}
      }
    }
  }],
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "people",
      "id": "42",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 80,
        "gender": "male"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Request with `fields[articles]` and `fields[people]` parameters:

```http
GET /articles?include=author&fields[articles]=title,body,author&fields[people]=name HTTP/1.1
```

> Note: The above example URI shows unencoded `[` and `]` characters simply
for readability. In practice, these characters should be percent-encoded, as
noted in the base specification. See "[Square Brackets in Parameter Names](/format/1.1/#appendix-query-details-square-brackets)".

Here we want `articles` objects to have fields `title`, `body` and `author` only and `people` objects to have `name` field only.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!",
      "body": "The shortest article. Ever."
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "data": {"id": "42", "type": "people"}
      }
    }
  }],
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "people",
      "id": "42",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "John"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Pay attention to the fact that you have to add a relationship name both in `include` and `fields` (since relationships are fields too), otherwise you'll get:

```http
GET /articles?include=author&fields[articles]=title,body&fields[people]=name HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!",
      "body": "The shortest article. Ever."
    }
  }],
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "people",
      "id": "42",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "John"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: The above example URI shows unencoded `[` and `]` characters simply
for readability. In practice, these characters should be percent-encoded, as
noted in the base specification. See "[Square Brackets in Parameter Names](/format/1.1/#appendix-query-details-square-brackets)".

## <a href="#pagination" id="pagination" class="headerlink"></a> Pagination Links

Example of a page-based strategy on how to add [pagination links](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).

Basic request:

```http
GET /articles?page[number]=3&page[size]=1 HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "meta": {
    "totalPages": 13
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "articles",
      "id": "3",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!",
        "body": "The shortest article. Ever.",
        "created": "2015-05-22T14:56:29.000Z",
        "updated": "2015-05-22T14:56:28.000Z"
      }
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=3&page[size]=1",
    "first": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=1&page[size]=1",
    "prev": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=2&page[size]=1",
    "next": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=4&page[size]=1",
    "last": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=13&page[size]=1"
  }
}
```

> Note: The above example URIs show unencoded `[` and `]` characters simply
for readability. In practice, these characters should be percent-encoded, as
noted in the base specification. See "[Square Brackets in Parameter Names](/format/1.1/#appendix-query-details-square-brackets)".

> Note: Putting a property like `"totalPages"` in `"meta"` can be a convenient way
to indicate to clients the total number of pages in a collection (as opposed to
the `"last"` link, which simply gives the URI of the last page). However, all
`"meta"` values are implementation-specific, so you can call this member whatever
you like (`"total"`, `"count"`, etc.) or not use it at all.

## <a href="#error-objects" id="error-objects" class="headerlink"></a> Error Objects

Examples of how [error objects](http://jsonapi.org/format/#error-objects) work.

### <a href="#error-objects-basics" id="error-objects-basics" class="headerlink"></a> A Basic Error Object

In the response below, the server is indicating that it encountered an error
while creating/updating the resource, and that this error was caused
by an invalid `"firstName"` attribute:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/firstName" },
      "title":  "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "First name must contain at least three characters."
    }
  ]
}
```

Every member in an error object is optional, but all help the client
by providing extra details.

The `source` member is used to [indicate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)
which part of the request document caused the error.

The `title` and `detail` members are similar, but `detail` is specific
to this occurrence of the problem, whereas `title` is more generic.

The `status` member represents the HTTP status code associated with the problem.
It's very helpful when multiple errors are returned at once (see below), as the
HTTP response itself can only have one status code. However, it can also be
useful for single errors, to save clients the trouble of consulting the HTTP
headers, or for using JSON:API over non-HTTP protocols, which may be officially
supported in the near future.

### <a href="#error-objects-multiple-errors" id="error-objects-multiple-errors" class="headerlink"></a> Multiple Errors

When multiple errors occur in response to a single request, the server
can simply add each error to the `errors` array:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "403",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/secretPowers" },
      "detail": "Editing secret powers is not authorized on Sundays."
    },
    {
      "status": "422",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/volume" },
      "detail": "Volume does not, in fact, go to 11."
    },
    {
      "status": "500",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/reputation" },
      "title": "The backend responded with an error",
      "detail": "Reputation service not responding after three requests."
    }
  ]
}
```

The only uniqueness constraint on error objects is the `id` field. Thus,
multiple errors on the same attribute can each be given their own error
object. The example below shows multiple errors on the `"firstName"` attribute:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/firstName" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "First name must contain at least three characters."
    },
    {
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/firstName" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "First name must contain an emoji."
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: in the responses above with a 422 status code, `400 Bad Request` would
also be acceptable. ([More details.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20215807/1261879))
JSON:API doesn't take a position on 400 vs. 422.

### <a href="#error-objects-error-codes" id="error-objects-error-codes" class="headerlink"></a> Error Codes

The `code` member of an error object contains an application-specific code
representing the type of problem encountered. `code` is similar to `title`
in that both identify a general type of problem (unlike `detail`, which is
specific to the particular instance of the problem), but dealing with `code`
is easier programatically, because the "same" `title` may appear in different
forms due to localization.

For the example below, imagine the API docs specifed the following mapping:

| Code | Problem                                                   |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  123 | Value too short                                           |
|  225 | Password lacks a letter, number, or punctuation character |
|  226 | Passwords do not match                                    |
|  227 | Password cannot be one of last five passwords             |

Multiple errors on `"password"` attribute, with error `code`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "jsonapi": { "version": "1.0" },
  "errors": [
    {
      "code":   "123",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/firstName" },
      "title":  "Value is too short",
      "detail": "First name must contain at least three characters."
    },
    {
      "code":   "225",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/password" },
      "title": "Passwords must contain a letter, number, and punctuation character.",
      "detail": "The password provided is missing a punctuation character."
    },
    {
      "code":   "226",
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/password" },
      "title": "Password and password confirmation do not match."
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that this response includes not only the `errors` top-level member,
but the `jsonapi` top-level member. Error responses may not contain the
top-level `data` member, but can include all the other top-level members
JSON:API defines.

Also, notice that the third error object lacks a `detail` member (perhaps
for security). Again, all error object members are optional.

### <a href="#error-objects-source-usage" id="error-objects-source-usage" class="headerlink"></a> Advanced `source` Usage

In the example below, the user is sending an invalid JSON:API
request, because it's missing the `data` member:

```http
PATCH /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{ "datum": [ ] }
```

Therefore, the server responds:

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocesssable Entity
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "source": { "pointer": "" },
      "detail":  "Missing `data` Member at document's top level."
    }
  ]
}
```

It uses `source` to point to the top-level of the document (`""`).
(Pointing to "/" would be an appropriate reference to the string
`"some value"` in the request document `{"": "some value"}`.
Pointing to `"/data"` would be invalid because the request document did
not have a value at `"/data"`, and `source` is always given with reference
to the request document.)

If the server cannot parse the request as valid JSON, including
`source` doesn't make sense (because there's no JSON document for `source` to
refer to). Here's how the server might respond to an invalid JSON document:

```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "status": "400",
    "detail": "JSON parse error - Expecting property name at line 1 column 2 (char 1)."
  }]
}
```

#### <a href="#error-objects-invalid-query-parameters" id="error-objects-invalid-query-parameters" class="headerlink"></a> Invalid Query Parameters

The `source` member can also be used to indicate that the error originated
from a problem with a URI query parameter, like so:

```http
GET /api/posts/1?include=author HTTP/1.1
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "source": { "parameter": "include" },
      "title":  "Invalid Query Parameter",
      "detail": "The resource does not have an `author` relationship path."
    }
  ]
}
```

In most cases, JSON:API requires the server to return an error when it encounters
an invalid value for a JSON:API–defined query parameter. However, for API-specific
query parameters (i.e. those not defined by JSON:API), a server may choose to
ignore an invalid parameter and have the request succeed, rather than respond with
an error. [API-specific query parameters must contain one non a-z
character.](http://jsonapi.org/format/#query-parameters)

Other examples of invalid parameters include: `?felds[people]=` (invalid parameter name; 
should be `fields[people]`) and `?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.owasp.org` (invalid parameter, 
in this case, a phishing attack), etc.
