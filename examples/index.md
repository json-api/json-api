title: "JSON API: Examples"
---

Examples are excellent learning aids. The following projects implementing JSON
API are divided into server- and client-side. The server-side is further
divided by implementation language. If you'd like your project listed, [send a
Pull Request](https://github.com/json-api/json-api).

## Client

[ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) is one of the original examplar
implementations, but is slightly out of date at the moment.

## Server

### PHP

* [FriendsOfSymfony / FOSRestBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/issues/452)

### Ruby

[ActiveModel::Serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
is one of the original examplar implementations, but is slightly out of date at
the moment.

[The rabl wiki](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl/wiki/Conforming-to-jsonapi.org-format)
has page describing how to emit conformant JSON.
