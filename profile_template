Here, specify your profile. This description should be detailed enough to allow
for interoperable implementations, but it otherwise doesn't need to be formal.
At the very least, describe the elements (document data or query parameters)
your profile defines and the allowed values for each.

Make sure you __follow the authoring guidelines__, which describe what profiles
are and are not allowed to do, and how they should be designed to evolve over time.

Those authoring guidelines are at:
  http://jsonapi.org/format/1.1/#profiles-authoring

Finally, it is **strongly encouraged** that your profile reuse objects,
patterns, and key names from the main JSON API specification where appropriate.

For instance, if your profile defines a field that points to another JSON API
resource, that field should hold a resource identifier object. Or, if your
extension defines a "type" key, it should use that key as JSON API does
(i.e. to hold a string indicating a resource's type).
